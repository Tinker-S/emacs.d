* A fast and robust Emacs setup
Previously I use [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]], then I found that there is so much feature which I rarely use and which indeed slow down my emacs. So I try to customize my own config based on [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d][redguardtoo/emacs.d]]. 

** My customization
- Change evil escape keysequence from ="kj"= to ="fd"=
- Change =~/.custom.el= to =~/.emacs.d/personal.el= and add it to git. Later I'll put most of my custom config into it
- Collect some of my favourite color themes, and random load a theme everytime emacs startup. The theme list may change according to my liking
